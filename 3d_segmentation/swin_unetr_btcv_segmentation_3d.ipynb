MetaTensors have the benefit of carrying the metadata directly with the tensor, but in some use cases (like here with training, where training data are only used for computing loss and metadata is not useful), we can safely disregard the metadata to improve speed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, in the following demos we will display example validation images, which uses metadata, so we use `EnsureTyped` with `track_meta = True`. Since there are no random transforms during validation, tracking metadata for validation images causes virtually no slowdown (~0.5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the next section, you will see `set_track_meta(False)`. This is a global API introduced in MONAI 0.9.1, and it makes sure that random transforms will also be performed using Tensors rather than MetaTensors. Used together with `track_meta=False` in `EnsureTyped`, it results in all transforms being performed on Tensors, which we have found to speed up training."
